Jamie originally streamed this to the wrong Twitch channel ([Waffling Taylors](https://twitch.tv/wafflingtaylors)), but will be combining both videos into one for YouTube.

## Lessons Learned

- `git commit -a -m "{message here}"`
  - Adds commits changes to the repo with a given message (`{message here}`)
  - However, this only adds _modified_ files
  - It _DOES NOT ADD_ any new files
  - For new files, you must use `git add`
