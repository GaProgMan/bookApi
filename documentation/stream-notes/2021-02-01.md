Jamie originally streamed this to the wrong Twitch channel ([Waffling Taylors](https://twitch.tv/wafflingtaylors)), but will be combining both videos into one for YouTube.

  - The git documentation for branching and merging

## Lessons Learned

- Check the stream key value within OBS _before_ starting the stream
  - The first hour of the stream was actually sent up to the wrong channel
  - Jamie has a process in place for this, going forward
- `git commit -a -m "{message here}"`
  - Adds commits changes to the repo with a given message (`{message here}`)
- `git checkout -b {branch name}`
  - Creates and swaps over to a new branch with the given name (`{branch name}`)
- Tab completion works on branch names
  - `git commit -u origin {branch name here}`
